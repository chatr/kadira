### v2.22.0
* We've seen some users getting older version when installed via `meteor add meteorhacks:kadira`. We've no idea when it's happening. May be because we still support Meteor `0.9`. 
* So, this version drops Meteor `0.9` support and only support Meteor `1.0` or higher.

* Fix an issue with the time-sync logic
* Do not retry if kadira engine return a status code of range 400-500 (except 401. It throws an error.)
